** General
+ =/on= Turns the lights on. (Fading them in) 
+ =/off= Turns the lights off. (Fading them out) 
+ =/desk/red/green/blue= Sets the desk lights (string A) to =red=, =green=, =blue= 
+ =/a/red/green/blue= Shorthand for above. 
+ =/window/red/green/blue= Sets the window lights (string B) to =red=, =green=, =blue=

+ =/work/brightness= Sets the worklight to =brightness=. 
+ =/w/brightness= Shorthand for above. 

** Fading
Adding =/fade= to the beginning of any of the above commands makes
them fade to that color in a reasonable amount of time. If you want to
specify the fade time, simply add =/fade/fadeTime/= to the beginning
of one of the above commands. 


** POST
You can post data, if you'd prefer that. (The default WebUI does.) You
have the following post fields. 

*N.B.:* If you post a value for red for a color, you MUST post Green
and Blue as well, otherwise you'll freak the python out.

# TODO: Fix that. 

The following post fields are valid: 
+ a_red :: A's new red value
+ a_grn :: A's new green value
+ a_blu :: A's new blue value
+ a_fad :: A's fade time. (default: 0) 

+ b_red :: B's new red value
+ b_grn :: B's new green value
+ b_blu :: B's new blue value
+ b_fad :: B's fade time. (default: 0) 

+ w_brt :: W's new brightness 
+ w_fad :: W's fade time. (default: 0)


# TODO: Add python interfaces.
